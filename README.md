# Nessus
Vulnerability Management
## Objective

Nessus is to identify and assess security vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications. Nessus is a vulnerability scanner that helps security professionals it scans systems for known vulnerabilities such as misconfigurations, unpatched software, and exploitable vulnerabilities.it ensure that systems are compliant with industry security standardsidenand identifying missing patches and outdated software, Nessus assists in keeping systems up-to-date,providing detailed reports with severity levels (critical, high, medium, and low) for each identified vulnerability.

### Skills Learned

- Vulnerability Assessment: Understanding how to identify and assess vulnerabilities in various systems and networks..
- Scanning and Reporting: Proficiency in configuring scans, analyzing results, and generating comprehensive reports on vulnerabilities..
- Patch Management: Proficiency in configuring scans, analyzing results, and generating comprehensive reports on vulnerabilities..
- Risk Management: Evaluating and prioritizing vulnerabilities based on risk factors and potential impact.
- Security Best Practices: Understanding and implementing security best practices and remediation strategies.

### Usage
I have used Nessus for Scanning Vulnerability for Windows VM and metasploitable 2 vm these are the steps have been followed 

### Steps
Step1 
- Setting UP VMs
- Install windows vm and metasploitable 2 server from google
links
```python
https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/
https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/latest/download
```
- after that configure the setting leave all default,but network adopter should be in Bridged(Automatic) option

step 2 
- Installation of Nessus
- Now install Nessus 
```python
https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?loginAttempted=true
```
- choose the platform as windows 84 and 64 bits, if use are using other os change the platform
- Fill name and email they will send a activation key to your email
- Installshield Wizard will appear click install and finish
- It automatically goes to browser with a welcome page of nessus
- save the url it should be like localhost:8834/WelcomeToNessus-Install/welcome
- click on connect via ssl browser will show warning like not safe use advanced option and processed 
- it will show initializing the process will take time
- select the free version (note:you should select student purpose its free trail you should select before entering username and password ) 
- enter name and email if you filled at starting skip it

- enter username and password remember them and submit 
- it will show initializing
- u will get a login page
step 4
- u have to enter your username and password
- u will go to a Nessus dashboard
- u will find multiple types of scanning options like host mobile etc
- choose the basic scan and enter the ip address of the machine that u have to scan
- give the credentials of the machine it will take 8-10 mins
- u will get the report with priority then solve the vulnerability patch the system software
- and the run again

vulnerability management is a process that has to be performed often due to software updates new malware 

# Qualys VM

It's a cloud-based application
main point to be remembered in VM they are

- preparation(asset management, hardware)
- Vulnerability identification
- risk management (cvss score)
- threat analysis
- prioritization like risk range
- remediation patches
- verification rescan report compliance
- continuous improvement
